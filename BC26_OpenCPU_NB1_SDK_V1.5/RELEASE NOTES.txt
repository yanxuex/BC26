OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.5
Sep 5  2019
1.Update the dfota user guide.
2.Add the example and RIL APIs of MQTT.
3.Add interface that control UART send data to 485 device.
4.Modify the return value of the interface function that checks the status of the SIM card.
5.Delete the URC of receive data in TCP/UDP,change to callback mode to print received data.
6.Delete the URC of receive data in LwM2M,change to callback mode to print received data.
7.Delete the URC of receive data in MQTT ,change to callback mode to print received data.
8.Delete the URC of receive data in Onenet,change to callback mode to print received data.
9.Add an event interface that supports called by hardware interrupt.

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.4  
May 5  2019
1.Added the GPIO pins (GPIO0, USB_MODE, GPIO6~GPIO8).
2.Added timer API for microsecond counting.
3.Added Ql_Timer_Delete API to delete current timer ID.
4.Added Ql_Delay_us API to microsecond delay.
5.Added Ql_UART_GetOption API to query UART parameters.
6.Added Ql_OS_GetCurrenTaskLeftStackSize API for querying remaining stack size for dedicated task.
7.Added Ql_UART_GetOption API to query UART parameters.
8.Added Ql_ADC_Read API to single read ADC values.
9.Fixed the bug that UART will be stuck when receive 1400 more bytes in one time.
10.Fixed the bug that the time reading result is wrong when set a time-zone not equal to 32 using Ql_SetLocalTime API.
11.Update the return value of event and mutex interfaces.
12.Update Functional Documents and AT Documents.
13.Added Ql_OS_GetTaskTickCount and Ql_OS_GetTaskTickCountFromISR API to count of ticks.

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.3 
March 10  2019
1.Update Functional Documents and AT Documents.
2.Unrestricted the time interval limitation of ADC sampling. The minimum time interval can be configured as 10ms.
3.Modified the implementation of Ql_OS_GetMessage for dedicated scenarios – ADC/Normal EINT/Normal TIMER. This function will
not return after the callback is called. It will go to the message receive code again internally to fetch the next message.
4.Fixed the bug that some GPIOs will hop during power on phase.
5.Update the RTC、LWM2M and onenet example.
6.Fixed the bug that json data cannot be receive in onenet.
7.Supported upgrade APP bin file via DFOTA. 

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.2
Nov 20  2018
1.Fixed the bug that json data cannot be processed in TCP/UDP.
2.Fixed the bug that change the RIL interface of network protocol to solve the problem of memory leakage.
3.Optimized the behavior to obtain receiving format in TCP/UDP.
4.Fixed the bug that the front packet data is covered by the last packet data in the onenet of write request from OneNET platform or
Application Server.
5.Fixed the bug that the module will crash when frequent using AT+QRST.
6.Fixed the bug that -4(RIL_AT_INVALID_PARAM)is returned when calling Ql_RIL_SendATCmd() to send non AT commands.
7.Modified the buffer length of the RIL interface to 1400 bytes.
